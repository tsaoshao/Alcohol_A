To make way for further analysis, variable names were transformed into lowercase form with underscores. `post_id` and `viewer_id` were converted to character because they are only categorical variables without numerical meaning. `post_comments`, `post_likes` and `post_views` were then converted from `double` to `integer` to avoid analytic errors. As time-sensitive variables like `post_time` and `sync_time` were recognised as datetime type by `read_csv()`, time parsing functions were not used.
